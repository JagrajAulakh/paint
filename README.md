# Paint Project

### What is it?
This program is a clone of MS Paint with a Minecraft theme. I desgined and programmed it by myself for a school project in highschool. The project required us to make a paint program with a twist: we could design the program with any theme we'd like. So I chose the classic video game Minecraft

### What does it use?
The program is made in Python 3 with the use of the PyGame library for graphics related tasks.
